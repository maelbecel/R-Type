## Introduction

OpenGL is a cross-platform graphics API that enables developers to create high-performance 2D and 3D graphics applications. It is widely used in the video game industry and other fields such as scientific visualization and CAD/CAM engineering.


## Architecture

The OpenGL API is designed to be simple and efficient. It provides a set of functions for drawing primitives such as points, lines, and triangles. These primitives can be combined to create more complex shapes and scenes. OpenGL also supports a variety of features such as lighting, texturing, and shading.
It's divided in multiple parts :

- [**Buffer**](OpenGLBuffer.md)
- [**Context**](OpenGLContext.md)
- [**FrameBuffer**](OpenGLFramebuffer.md)
- [**FrameBufferUtils**](OpenGLFramebufferUtils.md)
- [**RendererAPI**](OpenGLRendererAPI.md)
- [**Shader**](OpenGLShader.md)
- [**Texture**](OpenGLTexture.md)
- [**TextureUtils**](OpenGLTextureUtils.md)
- [**UniformBuffer**](OpenGLUniformBuffer.md)
- [**VertexArray**](OpenGLVertexArray.md)
