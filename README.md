# EPITECH Project - R-Type

Replicate of the `rtype` game.

## Usage & Examples

You can use the bash script `make.sh` if you want to try.

First at all, you will have this menu when you launch the script. Here you can choose which command execute.

```bash
Menu Make:
1. make
2. make re
3. make clean
4. make fclean
5. Examples
6. Sandbox
0. Quitter
Choisissez une option (0-6):
```

If you choose 'Examples' (5) or 'Sandbox' (6), a new menu will be opened.

```bash
Choisissez une option (0-6): 5
Menu Examples:
1. make
2. make re
3. make clean
4. make fclean
0. Retour au menu principal
00. Quitter
Choisissez une option (0-4):
```

The 'Examples' section is for compiling Game-Engine examples. The goal is to try features from our Game-Engine.

The 'Sandbox' section is our laboratory where we try out all the things we need or want to implement.
